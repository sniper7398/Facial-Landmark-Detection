# Facial-Landmark-Detection
This repo is about detecting facial keypoints using various methods.I have used a CNN model as my main model.I have collected dataset from kaggle. Accuracy of basic CNN model is about 70%.
I have tested my dataset on two model:
1-Basic model :
    Dense layer
    Activation-Relu
    Optimizer-SGD
    Loss Function-MSE(Mean Squared Error)
2:CNN Model
  accuracy=About 70%
  Keras Layout
  optimizer-adam
  Loss Function-MSE(Mean Squared Error)
